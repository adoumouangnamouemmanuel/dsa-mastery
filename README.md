## 🛠️ Technical Focus

As a Computer Engineering student in Ghana, I am currently bridging the gap between hardware-level logic and high-level software efficiency.

- **Current Course:** Data Structures and Algorithms (Semester 2, 2026).
- **Language Learning:** Actively implementing DSA patterns in **Rust** to master memory safety and ownership.
- **Active Project:** Applying data transmission and monitoring logic to my **Precision Agriculture** project.

## 🎯 2027 Master's Goals

I am curating this repository to demonstrate technical rigor for my upcoming applications to universities in **China and France**.

- [x] Link LeetHub for automated synchronization.
- [ ] Implement all core Data Structures (Trees, Graphs, Heaps) in Rust.
- [ ] Maintain a 100+ day LeetCode streak.
