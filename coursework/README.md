## 🔬 Lab Focus Areas

Following the curriculum for my Bachelor's degree, these labs prioritize:

- **Time Complexity Analysis:** Rigorous $O(n)$ analysis for every algorithm implemented.
- **Java Mastery:** Leveraging object-oriented principles and the Java Collections Framework.
- **Memory Management:** Understanding Heap vs. Stack allocation in a Java environment.

## 🛰️ Featured Project: Precision Agriculture

As part of my current "carine course," I am integrating DSA principles into a **Precision Agriculture** system.

- **Goal:** Efficient data transmission and chemical monitoring for irrigation systems.
- **DSA Application:** Utilizing graph algorithms for optimal sensor placement and data routing.
