# 🧪 Data Structures & Algorithms: Lab Submissions

This directory contains my weekly lab implementations for the Data Structures and Algorithms course (2026). Each lab focuses on a specific data structure or algorithmic paradigm, emphasizing implementation from scratch in **Java**.

## 🛠️ Lab Implementation Standard

Each lab folder is structured as follows to ensure clarity and professional documentation:

1. **Problem Statement:** A brief description of the lab objectives provided by the department.
2. **Design Logic:** A summary of the chosen data structure and why it was selected.
3. **Complexity Analysis:**
   - **Time Complexity:** Explicitly stated using Big O notation (e.g., $O(n)$ for linear traversal).
   - **Space Complexity:** Analysis of memory overhead on the JVM Heap.
4. **Source Code:** Well-commented Java files following `PascalCase` naming conventions.

## 🚀 Learning Objectives

- Implementation of custom data structures without relying solely on the `java.util` package.
- mastering pointer/reference manipulation for complex structures like Trees and Graphs.
- Applying unit testing to verify algorithm correctness against edge cases.
