## 🔍 Focus Areas

In these assignments, I demonstrate my ability to:

- **Mathematically Prove Complexity:** Using the Master Theorem or Substitution Method to solve recurrence relations.
- **Algorithm Selection:** Justifying the choice of a specific data structure based on hardware constraints and use-case requirements.
- **System Design:** Designing abstract solutions for real-world engineering problems before moving to implementation.

## 🛠️ Assignment Workflow

1. **Problem Analysis:** Breaking down the prompt into its core constraints.
2. **Mathematical Modeling:** Defining the efficiency using $O$, $\Omega$, and $\Theta$ notations.
3. **Pseudo-code:** Drafting the logic to ensure language-agnostic correctness.
4. **Verification:** Testing the logic against boundary cases (e.g., empty inputs, maximum constraints).
